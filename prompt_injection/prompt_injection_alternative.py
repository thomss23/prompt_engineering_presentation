Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the special and
general theories of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside
quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

In his special theory of relativity, Einstein showed that space and time are not absolute,
but relative to the observer. This has profound implications for our understanding of the
universe. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein developed a new theory of gravity
that is based on the curvature of spacetime. This theory has been used to explain a wide
range of phenomena, including the expansion of the universe and the existence of black holes.

Einstein was a brilliant and original thinker who made fundamental contributions to our
understanding of the universe. He is one of the most famous and influential scientists of all time."""
